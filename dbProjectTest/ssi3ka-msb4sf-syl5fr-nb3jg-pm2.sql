Drain al dente pasta into colander in bowl, while reserving pasta water in bowl. Measure out 1 cup hot pasta water and discard remaining water. Place pasta in now empty large bowl.

Over medium heat, add the garlic, whites of the scallions, and cauliflower to the skillet. Saute until the cauliflower shows some caramelization. Then add the wine until the florets are tender-crisp. Add salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. When pasta is just shy of al dente, reserve about a cup of the cooking water and drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the skilletâstill over medium heatâwith the veggies and toss with some pasta water, as necessary (I added a little at a time; I ended up using about 1/2 cup), till the pasta is coated and turns easily.

Repeat this until the water is no longer cloudy (usually 3-4 rinses).After draining off the rinse water, add 3 cups of cold water to the pot. Bring to a boil over high heat without a lid. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to warm and cook with a lid on for 10 minutes. After ten minutes, turn the heat off and let sit (with the lid still on) for an additional 15 minutes. Mix together the rice vinegar, sugar and salt. Microwave for 20 seconds and stir to dissolve the sugar and salt. Microwave additional time, if needed, to help the sugar and salt dissolve.Once the rice has finished cooking, dump it out from the pot into a large bowl. Sprinkle half of the vinegar/sugar/salt mixture onto the rice and gently fold it in until it is well incorporated (try not to squish the rice). Sprinkle the remainder of the vinegar mixture on the rice and fold it in again until it is evenly mixed and the rice looks shiny and is fairly sticky.While the rice is cooking, wash and cut/slice the cucumber, raddish, carrot (I shredded mine) and avocado. Place one cup of cooked sushi rice in each bowl and divide your toppings evenly between the six bowls. I like to arrange the toppings in a pretty way to make it feel even more like Im eating real sushi.Sprinkle -1/2 tsp of sesame seeds over each bowl.
